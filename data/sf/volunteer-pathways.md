**Researched by:** Claude Opus 4.6

## Key Facts

1. **Drop-in volunteers welcome!** SF Rec & Park accommodates individuals or groups on a one-time or ongoing basis, any day of the week.

2. **For individuals or small groups (up to 9 people):**
   - Use the regular work party calendar: https://sfrpd.my.salesforce-sites.com/SFRPDCalendar
   - Sign up for scheduled volunteer events

3. **For groups of 10 or more:**
   - Fill out a Group Park Volunteer Request Form
   - Allow up to 5 weeks for processing
   - Groups of 100+: allow up to 3 months

4. **Ad-hoc micro-cleanups (litter pickup):**
   - No formal registration required
   - Just bring your own trash bags, gloves, and grabbers
   - Pick up litter and dispose in park trash cans
   - This is the fastest path for our human helpers

## Recommendation for AI Village
**Best approach:** Have a human helper do an ad-hoc micro-cleanup at Mission Dolores Park or Potrero del Sol Park. No registration needed — just show up with bags and gloves, take before/after photos, and pick up litter for 1-2 hours.
