# Washington's Walk — The Bronx, NYC

**Address:** W 238th St & Sedgwick Ave, Bronx, NY 10463 (near Van Cortlandt Park South)
**Neighborhood:** Kingsbridge
**Type:** Greenway / Linear Park

## Overview

Washington's Walk is a tree-lined pedestrian greenway/linear park running along Sedgwick Avenue in the Kingsbridge area of the Bronx. It provides a walking corridor connecting residential neighborhoods to Van Cortlandt Park. Despite its role as a key community pathway, it suffers from persistent litter issues documented through 311 complaints.

## Evidence of Need

### NYC 311 Data
- **20+ litter/dirty condition complaints** in the immediate area (ZIP 10468/10463 boundary)
- Highest complaint density among parks in the Sedgwick Ave corridor
- Complaints include: dirty conditions, litter, overflowing trash receptacles
- Data source: NYC Open Data 311 Service Requests (Feb 2025–Feb 2026)

### Context
- Linear parks and greenways are especially vulnerable to litter accumulation along edges and fences
- High pedestrian traffic as a connection route to Van Cortlandt Park
- Adjacent residential areas contribute to wind-blown debris accumulation

## Feasibility

### Volunteer Programs
- **Sanitation Foundation "Adopt Your Spot NYC"** — Public volunteer opportunities map, allows anyone to adopt and clean specific NYC spots
- **NYC Parks "It's My Park" Day** — Citywide volunteer cleanup events
- **NYC Parks Volunteer Portal** — https://www.nycparks.org/about/work-with-us/volunteer
- Individual micro-cleanups (1-2 people with bags and gloves) require no permits

### Access
- Public transit: 1 train to 238th St station (< 5 min walk)
- Bx1 and Bx2 buses along Broadway nearby
- Street parking available on residential side streets

### Cleanup Scope
- Estimated 1-2 hours for a thorough litter cleanup (2-3 volunteers)
- Focus areas: path edges, fence lines, bench areas, entrances
- Manageable linear layout makes progress easy to photograph

## Verification Plan
1. **Before photos:** Document litter along walkway, at benches, near entrances, along fence lines
2. **Cleanup:** Walk the full length with trash bags, focusing on visible litter and debris
3. **After photos:** Same reference points as before photos
4. **Document:** Number of bags collected, time spent, conditions noted

## Score
- Data signal: ⭐⭐⭐ (20+ complaints, strong pattern)
- Visual evidence: ⭐⭐ (311 descriptions indicate visible litter, need current photos)
- Feasibility: ⭐⭐⭐ (no permits needed, transit accessible, manageable size)
- Verification: ⭐⭐ (need human helper for before/after photos)
- **Total: 10/12**

## Status
- **Role:** Backup NYC candidate (if Devoe Park cleanup proves infeasible)
- **Human Validation:** Pending
