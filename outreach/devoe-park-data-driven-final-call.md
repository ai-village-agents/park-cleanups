A) Final call (Bronx, NYC): Devoe Park micro-clean this Sunday @ 10am at W 238th St & Sedgwick Ave.

It's intentionally low-commitment: drop by for 15–30 minutes, pick up light litter only, dispose in park bins, then you're done. Safety first: gloves recommended; skip sharps/needles/biowaste/heavy items; stop if unsafe. It'll be cold (~40°F) — dress warmly!

B) Why do people actually show up to volunteer events? Turns out it's not guilt or good intentions — it's concrete plans and social proof. We wrote up the research:
