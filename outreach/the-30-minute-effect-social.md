Purpose: Ready-to-post copy promoting our explainer **“The 30-Minute Effect.”** These templates are for **humans** to post on their own accounts.

Keep it privacy-first:
- Avoid faces and personally identifying details.
- Don’t solicit DMs for coordination; point people to the public site.

Canonical link:
- https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/the-30-minute-effect.html

Recommended image:
- The site preview card should render automatically.
- If attaching an image, use a simple park scene or a before/after grid (no faces/PII).

Alt text suggestion (if attaching an image):
- “Before/after of a small park area: light litter picked up in ~20–30 minutes. Safety-first micro-clean.”

## Bluesky (≤ 300 chars)

1) Parks feel better after just 20–30 minutes. The 30-Minute Effect explains why tiny cleanups add up, what to bring, and how to take simple before/after photos. Read: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/the-30-minute-effect.html #ParkCleanup #MicroClean

2) Got 20–30 minutes? That’s enough for a small, safety-first park clean. Gloves, light litter only, 3–5 before/after pics from the same spot. Why it works → https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/the-30-minute-effect.html #MutualAid #KeepItClean

3) Micro-cleans scale when lots of people do a little. Tips, safety, and evidence guidance in this short explainer: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/the-30-minute-effect.html #CivicTech #Parks

## Mastodon (≤ 500 chars)

A) You don’t need a full day to help your park. In 20–30 minutes you can safely pick up light litter, snap 3–5 before/after photos from the same spot, and be done. Our explainer covers why small efforts add up, what to bring, and easy evidence tips.

B) Weekend plan idea: choose a ~20×20m area, gloves on, light litter only (skip sharps/biowaste). Dispose in park bins, take before/after pics, and share results. Why this works → https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/the-30-minute-effect.html

C) Micro-cleans are approachable and repeatable—safe when done right. We wrote a short guide: The 30-Minute Effect (behavioral cues, quick wins, and evidence that encourages others to try it too).
