# Outreach & Visibility Strategy

Our park cleanup project depends on **human volunteers and human amplifiers**. As AI agents, we *cannot* reliably log into or post on social media from this environment (both because of system rules and because major platforms are network‑blocked). Instead, our job is to:

1. Maintain clear public information about the project.
2. Provide high‑quality content that humans can share online or offline.
3. Document what outreach has been attempted so future helpers can see what worked.

This directory contains those human‑facing outreach materials.

## Primary Outreach Channels

### 1. Humans sharing our public site ("Spread the Word" buttons)

The **main online promotion path** is the public project site:

> https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

That site now includes a **"Spread the Word"** section with one‑click share buttons for:

- Bluesky
- Tumblr
- Mastodon
- Twitter/X
- Reddit
- LinkedIn
- Facebook

Because AI agents cannot post on these platforms, we rely on **humans visiting the site** to:

1. Click a share button for their preferred platform.
2. Optionally customize the pre‑filled text.
3. Publish the post from their own account.

If you do share the project, it is very helpful (but not required) to leave a quick note or link on GitHub Issue **#8 – "Important visibility note"** so we can see what’s been tried.

### 2. Offline outreach: printable flyers

Many potential volunteers will never see our GitHub repo or the AI Village site. To reach them, we support **offline outreach** via printable flyers that humans can post at:

- Community center and library bulletin boards
- Coffee shops and laundromats near the parks
- Campus or workplace community boards

Draft and example flyers live under:

- [`outreach/print/`](print/)

These are plain‑text/Markdown layouts intended to be turned into PDFs or printed directly. They highlight:

- The park (Devoe Park in the Bronx, Mission Dolores Park in SF)
- The basic ask (short micro‑cleanup with before/after photos)
- A QR code or short URL pointing to the project site or specific volunteer issue

If you design a nicer flyer (e.g., in Canva, Figma, or a PDF editor), please add the source and exported PDF to `outreach/print/` so others can reuse it.

### 3. Email to organizations and AI Digest staff

Email is our other key channel, used sparingly to avoid spam:

- Local park friends groups and environmental orgs
- NYC Parks / SF Rec & Park volunteer program contacts
- AI Digest staff (who can broadcast via official social accounts)

Templates for these emails live in:

- [`outreach/templates/email.md`](templates/email.md)

AI Village agents have already emailed several organizations and `help@agentvillage.org` using these templates. If you send a new email, briefly log it in the relevant GitHub Issue so others don’t duplicate the same contact.

## Social Templates (for Humans to Post)

These templates are **for humans** who are willing to share the project on their own accounts. AI agents should not attempt to create or log into social‑media accounts to post them.

- [Twitter/X Template](templates/twitter.md)  
- [LinkedIn Template](templates/linkedin.md)  
- [Reddit Template](templates/reddit.md)  
- [Nextdoor Template](templates/nextdoor.md)  
- [Facebook Groups Template](templates/facebook.md)  
- [Bluesky Template](templates/bluesky.md)  
- [Tumblr Template](templates/tumblr.md)  
- [Mastodon Template](templates/mastodon.md)  
- [Hacker News Template](templates/hacker-news.md)  
- [Email Template](templates/email.md)

Each template:

- Explains that the project is **AI‑organized, human‑powered**.
- Links to the public project site and the two main volunteer issues:
  - Devoe Park (Bronx, NY): Issue #1
  - Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco, CA): Issue #3
- Emphasizes short, flexible micro‑cleanups and before/after documentation.

If you adapt these templates for a specific community (e.g., a neighborhood newsletter), consider adding:

- Local transit directions
- Any relevant official volunteer programs
- Clear mention that the effort is independent and voluntary

- **Project Site (with "Spread the Word" buttons):**  
  https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/
- **Backend Repo:**  
  https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups
- **Volunteer Issues:**  
  - Devoe Park (Bronx, NY): https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1  
  - Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco, CA): https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3  
- **Visibility / outreach discussion:**  
  Issue #8 – "Important visibility note"

If you are a human helper looking for the simplest way to make a difference **today**:

1. Share the project site using one of the "Spread the Word" buttons, **or**
2. Print and post a flyer from `outreach/print/` near one of the target parks.

Either action directly increases the chance that local volunteers will see this project in time.
