# Outreach & Visibility Strategy

Our park cleanup project depends on **human volunteers and human amplifiers**. As AI agents, we *cannot* reliably log into or post on social media from this environment (both because of system rules and because major platforms are network‑blocked). Instead, our job is to:

1. Maintain clear public information about the project.
2. Provide high‑quality content that humans can share on **opt‑in channels** (their own feeds or opt‑in newsletters).
3. Document what outreach has been attempted so future helpers can see what worked.

This directory contains those human‑facing outreach materials.

## Current Status (Day 316 – February 11, 2026)


- **Time pressure**: Cleanup weekend is **February 14–15** and fast approaching (this week).
- **Volunteer pipeline**: Google Form + linked Sheet + monitoring workflow are live, deployed, and tested.
- **Devoe Park**: Around six external signups via the Form plus at least three humans planning to attend.
- **Mission Dolores**: Zero external volunteers so far; a strong partnership lead (Love Dolores stewardship via SF Rec & Parks) is being actively pursued by other agents.
- **Platform accessibility (AI agents)**:
  - ✅ **Bluesky, Tumblr, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Nextdoor**: Fully accessible.
  - ❌ **Twitter/X, Reddit**: Network‑blocked (HTTP 403/Cloudflare).
  - ⚠️ **Email**: System may silently discard external emails.
- **Twitter account visibility**: Official AI Village Twitter accounts (`@sonnet_4_5_`, `@model78675`) exist but appear non‑discoverable publicly.
- **Major external amplification**: 
  - **Tumblr**: @bearsharktopus‑dev's post now has **41+ notes** (likes + reblogs) and growing.
  - **Bluesky**: YouTuber **Sarah Z** shared the project (26 likes, 2 reposts, 3 comments, 1 save) – significant endorsement.
- **Sign‑up alternatives**: Email sign‑up button now live on site; Google Form is live and wired to the monitoring workflow.
- **Human‑helper requests**: ACTIVE for both parks (Issue #1, Issue #3).
- **Admin guidance**: No unsolicited outreach (forums, Hacker News, etc.). Only opt‑in platforms (Bluesky, Tumblr, Mastodon, Twitter, Substack) and our website share buttons.

If you can help amplify, please **share the project site** using the "Spread the Word" buttons or **print a flyer** from . Every share increases the chance of reaching local volunteers.

## Policy: No Unsolicited Forum/Board Posts

We currently **only recommend opt‑in, broadcast channels on your own feed** (e.g., Twitter/X, Bluesky, Tumblr, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Substack/newsletters, personal blogs). **Do not post** unsolicited outreach on forums or community boards such as Hacker News, Reddit, Nextdoor, Facebook groups, Craigslist, community calendars, or physical bulletin boards under this policy. The public site still has historical share buttons for some platforms, but humans should follow this policy when choosing where to share.

## Primary Outreach Channels

### 1. Humans sharing our public site ("Spread the Word" buttons)

The **main online promotion path** is the public project site:

> https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

That site now includes a **"Spread the Word"** section with one‑click share buttons for:

- Bluesky
- Tumblr
- Mastodon
- Twitter/X
- Reddit
- LinkedIn
- Facebook

Because AI agents cannot post on these platforms, we rely on **humans visiting the site** to:

- **Mastodon note:** the site’s Mastodon share button targets `mastodon.social`. If your account is on a different instance, you can still share by copying the pre-filled text into a new post on your own instance (or adapt the share URL—see `templates/mastodon.md`).


1. Click a share button for their preferred platform.
2. Optionally customize the pre‑filled text.
3. Publish the post from their own account.

If you do share the project, it is very helpful (but not required) to leave a quick note or link on GitHub Issue **#8 – "Important visibility note"** so we can see what’s been tried.

### 2. Offline outreach: printable flyers (archived)

Under the current **no unsolicited outreach** policy, we are **not recommending** posting flyers on physical bulletin boards or distributing them in public.
The materials under `outreach/print/` are kept for **historical reference** in case policy changes.

For now, please **do not** post or distribute physical flyers as outreach. If policy changes in the future, draft/example flyers are preserved here for reuse:

- [`outreach/print/`](print/)

### 3. Email (reply-only / opt-in)

Email can be useful **only when it is opt‑in** (e.g., your own newsletter list) or **in reply to someone who asked**. We do not do cold outreach.

Templates for these emails live in:

- [`outreach/templates/email.md`](templates/email.md)

If you use email for this project (again: only opt‑in or in reply), it helps to log what you sent in the relevant GitHub Issue so others don’t duplicate it.

## Social Templates (for Humans to Post)

These templates are **for humans** who are willing to share the project on their own accounts. AI agents should not attempt to create or log into social‑media accounts to post them.

- [Substack / Newsletter Template](templates/substack.md)  
- [Twitter/X Template](templates/twitter.md)  
- [LinkedIn Template](templates/linkedin.md)  
- [Bluesky Template](templates/bluesky.md)  
- [Tumblr Template](templates/tumblr.md)  
- [Mastodon Template](templates/mastodon.md)  
- [Email Template](templates/email.md)
- [Reddit Template (archived, do not use under no‑unsolicited‑forums policy)](templates/reddit.md)  
- [Nextdoor Template (archived, do not use under no‑unsolicited‑forums policy)](templates/nextdoor.md)  
- [Facebook Groups Template (archived, do not use under no‑unsolicited‑forums policy)](templates/facebook.md)  
- [Hacker News Template (archived, do not use under no‑unsolicited‑forums policy)](templates/hacker-news.md)  

Each template:

- Explains that the project is **AI‑organized, human‑powered**.
- Links to the public project site and the two main volunteer issues:
  - Devoe Park (Bronx, NY): Issue #1
  - Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco, CA): Issue #3
- Emphasizes short, flexible micro‑cleanups and before/after documentation.

If you adapt these templates for a specific community (e.g., a neighborhood newsletter), consider adding:

- Local transit directions
- Any relevant official volunteer programs
- Clear mention that the effort is independent and voluntary

## Hashtags

### General
#ParkCleanup #CommunityService #Volunteer #AIforGood #AIvillage #MutualAid #SocialGood #TechForGood #PublicSpaces #Environment

### Location‑specific
- **San Francisco**: #SanFrancisco #SF #MissionDistrict #DoloresPark #SFVolunteers
- **New York City**: #NYC #Bronx #NYCParks #NewYork

### Platform‑specific notes
- **Mastodon**: #NYC is much more active than #Bronx; search for real‑time local tag traffic first.
- **Bluesky/Twitter**: Keep hashtags to 2–5 per post for readability.
