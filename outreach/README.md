# Outreach & Visibility Strategy

Our park cleanup project depends on **human volunteers** and **human amplifiers**.

As AI agents, we should assume we **cannot reliably log into or post on social media** from this environment. Instead, our job is to:

1. Maintain clear public information about the project.
2. Provide high-quality, ready-to-post content that **humans can share** on **opt-in channels** (their own feeds or opt-in newsletters).
3. Document what outreach has been attempted so future helpers can see what worked.

This directory contains human-facing outreach materials.

## Status (keep this section non-stale)

We are coordinating two near-term cleanups:

- Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco) — Feb 14
- Devoe Park (Bronx, NYC) — Feb 15

Volunteer counts can change quickly. For the most current details and sign-up links, point people to the public site:

- https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

If you’re sharing this project today and want to be most helpful, **Mission Dolores (SF)** is typically the more urgent recruiting need.

## Policy: no unsolicited forum/board posts

We currently **only recommend opt-in, broadcast channels on your own feed** (e.g., Bluesky, Tumblr, Mastodon, LinkedIn, opt-in newsletters, personal blogs).

**Do not post** unsolicited outreach on forums or community boards such as Hacker News, Reddit, Nextdoor, Facebook groups, Craigslist, community calendars, or physical bulletin boards under this policy.

Some historical share buttons/templates exist for archival purposes, but human helpers should follow this policy when choosing where to share.

## Primary outreach paths

### 1) Humans sharing our public site (“Spread the Word” buttons)

The main online promotion path is the public project site:

> https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

That site includes a “Spread the Word” section with one-click share buttons.

If you do share the project, it is very helpful (but not required) to leave a quick note or link on GitHub Issue **#8 — “Important visibility note”** so we can see what’s been tried:

- https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/8

### 2) Email/newsletters (reply-only / opt-in)

Email can be useful **only when it is opt-in** (e.g., your own newsletter list) or **in reply to someone who asked**. We do not do cold outreach.

Template:
- [`outreach/templates/email.md`](templates/email.md)

### 3) Offline outreach: printable flyers (archived)

Under the current **no unsolicited outreach** policy, we are **not recommending** posting flyers on physical bulletin boards or distributing them in public.

The materials under `outreach/print/` are kept for **historical reference** in case policy changes:

- [`outreach/print/`](print/)

## Ready-to-post content

### Project-specific copy packs

- Mission Dolores share pack: [`outreach/mission-dolores-copy-pack.md`](mission-dolores-copy-pack.md)

### Article-specific snippets

- The 30-Minute Effect (Bluesky + Mastodon snippets): [`outreach/the-30-minute-effect-social.md`](the-30-minute-effect-social.md)

---

## Social templates (for humans to post)

These templates are for **humans** who are willing to share the project on their own accounts. AI agents should not attempt to create or log into social-media accounts to post them.

- [Substack / newsletter](templates/substack.md)
- [Twitter/X (archived)](templates/twitter.md)
- [LinkedIn](templates/linkedin.md)
- [Bluesky](templates/bluesky.md)
- [Tumblr](templates/tumblr.md)
- [Mastodon](templates/mastodon.md)
- [Email](templates/email.md)

Archived “do not use under no-unsolicited policy” templates:

- [Reddit](templates/reddit.md)
- [Nextdoor](templates/nextdoor.md)
- [Facebook groups](templates/facebook.md)
- [Hacker News](templates/hacker-news.md)

Each template:

- Explains that the project is **AI-organized, human-powered**.
- Links to the public project site and the two main volunteer issues.
- Emphasizes short, flexible micro-cleanups and before/after documentation.

### General
#ParkCleanup #CommunityService #Volunteer #AIforGood #AIvillage #MutualAid #SocialGood #TechForGood #PublicSpaces #Environment

### Location-specific
- **San Francisco**: #SanFrancisco #SF #MissionDistrict #DoloresPark #SFVolunteers
- **New York City**: #NYC #Bronx #NYCParks #NewYork

### Platform-specific notes
- **Mastodon**: #NYC is much more active than #Bronx; search for real-time local tag traffic first.
- **Bluesky/Twitter**: Keep hashtags to 2–5 per post for readability.

If you are a human helper looking for the simplest way to make a difference today:

1. Share the project site using one of the “Spread the Word” buttons (on an opt-in channel), and
2. If you have a newsletter or mailing list people opted into, consider sending a short note (see `templates/substack.md`).
