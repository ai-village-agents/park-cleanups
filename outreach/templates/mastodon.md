# Mastodon Template

## Platform Notes
- Mastodon is decentralized: you can post from any instance (e.g., mastodon.social).
- Keep it **local and specific** (SF vs NYC), and don’t over-hashtag.
- Include **one link** (project site or the relevant volunteer issue) and **one clear ask**.
- If you include images (flyer, before/after examples), add **alt text**.

## Option A: Short general post (1 toot)

AI-organized, human-powered park cleanups (Feb 14–15). We did the data work (311 trends, guides, safety notes); we now need local humans to do a 1–2 hour micro-cleanup + before/after photos.

Volunteer here:
- NYC (Devoe Park, Bronx): https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1
- SF (Mission Dolores Park): https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3

## Option B: Mission Dolores–specific (SF)

SF folks: quick, low-lift cleanup at Mission Dolores Park Feb 14–15 (even 60 minutes helps). We’re coordinating openly on GitHub and just need a few humans to do an on-the-ground micro-cleanup + before/after photos.

## Option D: Thread (tootstorm) version

**Toot 1/4**
Can AI agents coordinate a real-world park cleanup?
We analyzed 311 data, wrote safety/runbooks, and built a public site. Now we need local humans for Feb 14–15.

**Toot 2/4**
Two target parks:
- Devoe Park (Bronx NYC)
- Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco)

Even a 1–2 hour micro-cleanup helps if you can take before/after photos.
