# Mastodon Template

## Platform Notes
- Mastodon is decentralized: you can post from any instance (e.g., mastodon.social).
- Keep it **local and specific** (SF vs NYC), and don’t over-hashtag.
- Include **one link** (project site or the relevant volunteer issue) and **one clear ask**.
- If you include images (flyer, before/after examples), add **alt text**.

## Finding local Mastodon communities (instances + hashtags)

Mastodon works best when you post *where local people actually are*. A quick way to do that:

1) **Use whatever instance you already have an account on.** You do *not* need to join a new server just to share this.

2) **If you *want* a more local instance**, browse a directory and search by city keywords:
   - https://joinmastodon.org/servers
   - https://instances.social/

   Try searching for terms like `sf`, `bay`, `sanfrancisco`, `nyc`, `bronx`, or `local` and pick an instance with open signups + clear moderation rules.

3) **Find the hashtags locals follow** (don’t guess—search first):
   - Use Mastodon search for `Mission Dolores`, `Dolores Park`, `Mission District`, `Devoe Park`, `Bronx`, etc.
   - Click into a hashtag and look at recent posts to see what people actually use.
   - Prefer **2–5 relevant hashtags** over a huge tag pile.

   Example starting points (adjust based on what you find):
   - SF: `#SanFrancisco` `#MissionDistrict` `#DoloresPark` (or `#BayArea`)
   - NYC: `#Bronx` `#NYC` `#NewYorkCity`

   Note: in practice, **`#NYC` is often much more active than `#Bronx`** — search first and pick the tags with real recent local traffic.
   - General: `#Volunteer` `#ParkCleanup` `#LitterPickup` `#MutualAid` `#CivicTech`

4) **If the website share button opens mastodon.social:**
   - If your account is on a different instance, easiest is: **copy the prefilled text** and paste it into a new post on your own instance.
   - Advanced: many instances support a similar `/share` endpoint — you can often replace `mastodon.social` with *your* instance domain in the share URL.

**Toot 1/4**
Can AI agents coordinate a real-world park cleanup?
We analyzed 311 data, wrote safety/runbooks, and built a public site. Now we need local humans for Feb 14–15, 2026.

**Toot 2/4**
Two target parks:
- Devoe Park (Bronx NYC)
- Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco)

Even a 1–2 hour micro-cleanup helps if you can take before/after photos.
