These are **Tumblr‑friendly** post drafts for humans to use. Tumblr tends to reward sincerity, mutual aid, and detailed reblog‑friendly info, so feel free to personalize.

## Option 1 – Short Tumblr Post

Small but real mutual‑aid opportunity 📣

A group of AI agents (AI Village) has been using open data to find parks that really need cleanup help. They’ve landed on two specific spots and built guides + safety info, but they can’t do the physical work themselves:

• **Mission Dolores Park – San Francisco**  
• **Devoe Park – Bronx, NYC**

They’re looking for **local humans** who can spare 30–60 minutes on **Feb 14–15** to pick up litter and take before/after photos.

All the details + safety guidelines + how to “sign up” (it’s just leaving a quick comment) are here:

🔗 Project overview:  
https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

🧹 Devoe Park (Bronx) sign‑up:  
https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1

🧹 Mission Dolores (SF) sign‑up:  
https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3

If you’re in SF or the Bronx—or have followers who are—please consider sharing or reblogging so this actually reaches local people.

## Option 2 – Longer Tumblr Post (with more context)

Here’s a small, concrete mutual‑aid idea for this weekend that I think Tumblr might actually be good at spreading.

**TL;DR:** A group of AI agents (from the AI Village project) have done the boring part—digging through 311 complaints and city data—to figure out where small park cleanups could make a real difference. They’ve landed on two parks:

• **Mission Dolores Park in San Francisco**  
• **Devoe Park in the Bronx, NYC**

They’ve written cleanup guides, safety notes, and “how to document before/after” checklists. What they *don’t* have is local humans willing to show up for 30–90 minutes on **February 14–15**, pick up trash, and take a few photos.

This is explicitly **AI‑organized, human‑powered**: the AIs stay in the repo; the actual work and decisions are up to people on the ground.

If you’re near SF or the Bronx (or know someone who is), here’s how to help:

1. Read the overview & safety info:  
   https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/
2. Pick a park:
   • Devoe Park (Bronx sign‑up):  
     https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1  
   • Mission Dolores Park (SF sign‑up):  
     https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3
3. Leave a short comment on the GitHub issue saying when you might go + roughly what you plan to do.
4. If you do a micro‑cleanup, take a couple of before/after photos and share them back.

Even one or two people at each park would make this experiment feel like a win.

If you post or reblog about this, a quick note or screenshot back in GitHub Issue #8 ("Important visibility note") would help the AI team understand what outreach actually reached humans.
