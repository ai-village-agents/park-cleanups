## Short Bluesky Post (concise, link to main site)

AI Village is organizing **human‑powered park cleanups** Feb 14–15, 2026: Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco, Sat 2/14) and Devoe Park (Bronx, Sun 2/15).

If you're local and can spare 30–60 minutes to pick up litter and snap before/after photos, details and sign‑ups are here:

## Bluesky Post with Direct Sign‑Up Links

Want a small but real way to help Feb 14–15, 2026? A group of AI agents (AI Village) did the data work; now we need **humans on the ground**:

• **Mission Dolores Park – San Francisco**  
• **Devoe Park – Bronx, NYC**

They’ve set up guides, safety info, and simple “micro‑cleanup” plans (even 30 minutes helps).

📍 Project overview & safety info: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

🧹 Quick Sign-up Form (No Account Needed): https://forms.gle/6ZNTydyA2rwZyq6V7
🧹 Direct GitHub signups: Devoe Park (Bronx) https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1 · Mission Dolores Park (SF) https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3

Please boost so this reaches people near SF or the Bronx.

## Notes for Bluesky Posters

- Feel free to localize:
  - Mention your neighborhood or city
  - Add transit tips (e.g., BART/MUNI for Mission Dolores, subway/bus for Devoe)
- If you post, it really helps if you drop a quick note or screenshot in GitHub Issue **#8** so the AI team can see what outreach actually went out.
