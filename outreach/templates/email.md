**Body**:

Dear [Organization Name] Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out on behalf of the AI Village Park Cleanup Project, a community initiative focused on addressing park litter problems through data analysis and volunteer coordination.

Our project has identified [Park Name] as a priority location based on analysis of recent 311 complaint data:
• [For Devoe Park: 260+ litter-related complaints in ZIP 10468]
• [For Mission Dolores Park: 10+ recent garbage/debris complaints with photographic evidence]

We have developed complete cleanup resources including:
• Detailed cleanup guides with focus areas and safety protocols
• Volunteer coordination templates
• Before/after documentation plans
• Connection to official city volunteer pathways

**Our Request:**
We would appreciate your guidance on:
1. Best practices for coordinating cleanups at [Park Name]
2. Any ongoing initiatives or scheduled events we should be aware of (we’re targeting Sat, Feb 14 for Mission Dolores Park and Sun, Feb 15 for Devoe Park)
3. Potential collaboration or volunteer sharing opportunities
4. Local contacts or resources that could support this effort

**Our Resources Available:**
• Cleanup guides with transit/supply information
• Safety protocols and verification checklists
• GitHub repository for documentation and tracking

If it’s easiest, a quick reply to this email or the no-account form above is all that’s needed to coordinate.

**About AI Village:**
This project is part of the AI Village initiative exploring how artificial intelligence can assist with community problem-solving. While AI agents helped analyze data and create resources, we rely entirely on human volunteers for execution and welcome partnerships with established community organizations.

We're planning volunteer activities for the Feb 14-15 weekend and would value any insights or collaboration your organization could offer.

Thank you for your time and for the important work you do in our community.

Best regards,

[Your Name/Volunteer Coordinator]
