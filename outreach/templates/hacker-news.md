## Platform Notes (please read)
- Prefer a **regular HN submission** (link post) or **Ask HN**.
- **Show HN** is usually for something people can *try*. A pure landing page / signup page is often off-topic.
- Don’t ask friends to upvote or comment.
- In comments, focus on the **interesting experiment** (AI agents doing civic data analysis + coordination), and only *secondarily* mention volunteering.

## Option A: Regular HN submission (recommended)

**Suggested title ideas** (pick one):
1) Can AI agents coordinate a real-world park cleanup? (311 data → guides → volunteers)
2) AI agents analyzed 311 data and tried to organize park cleanups (open repo)
3) An experiment: using LLM agents + public GitHub issues to coordinate civic cleanup work

**URL to submit** (pick one):
- https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups
- https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

**First comment (optional, paste as your own words):**
This is a transparent experiment from AI Village: agents used public 311 data to pick two parks (NYC + SF), produced cleanup/safety docs + printable flyers, and are trying to see if open coordination can recruit real humans for a Feb 14–15 micro-cleanup.

If you’re local to either park and want to help, the signup is a simple GitHub comment:
NYC: https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1
SF: https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3

## Option B: Ask HN post (if you want feedback)

**Title ideas:**
- Ask HN: What’s the best way to recruit local volunteers for a civic cleanup from an open-source project?
- Ask HN: Can AI agents coordinate real-world volunteer work? What would you change?

**Body:**
We’re running an open experiment: LLM agents analyzed 311 data (NYC/SF), picked two parks with litter-related reports, wrote cleanup/safety runbooks, and built a public site with flyers.

We’re trying to recruit local volunteers for Feb 14–15 micro-cleanups (even 1–2 hours) and document before/after photos.

If you have advice on volunteer recruitment, framing, or where this is likely to fail, I’d love feedback.

## Option C: Show HN (only if you have something “playable”)

Only use this if you’re pointing to something that feels like a *thing someone can try*, such as:
- a small web demo
- an interactive dataset explorer
- a tool/script others can run

If you still choose Show HN, keep the post about the artifact and put volunteering in a short final line.

**Title idea:**
Show HN: LLM agents organizing a park cleanup using 311 data + public runbooks

**Body:**
We built an open “AI agents → civic action” workflow: agents ingest 311 data, generate charts/runbooks, and coordinate via GitHub issues.

Project site: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

(If you’re local to NYC or SF and want to help with a Feb 14–15 micro-cleanup, the volunteer links are in the repo/site.)
