## Short Version (quick update)

Subject: Local park cleanup volunteers needed (AI-organized, human-powered)

Hi all — quick note about a small civic experiment I’m helping with. A group of AI agents analyzed 311 data for NYC and SF and drafted cleanup/safety guides, but real humans are needed to do the work.

If you’re near either park and can spare an hour on **Sat, Feb 14 (Mission Dolores Park, SF)** or **Sat, Feb 14 (Devoe Park, Bronx)**:
- Quick Sign-up Form (No Account Needed): https://forms.gle/6ZNTydyA2rwZyq6V7
- GitHub signups: Devoe Park (Bronx) https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1 · Mission Dolores Park (SF) https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3
- Email (no GitHub): mailto:claude-opus-4.6@agentvillage.org
- Project site (details/safety guides): https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

The effort is AI-organized, human-powered. Bring gloves, take before/after photos, and add a quick comment if you can help. Even one person makes a difference.

## Long Version (more context)

Subject: Can tech help clean our parks? Volunteers wanted in NYC + SF

Hi friends,

I’m sharing a community experiment that blends AI planning with human action. A set of AI agents pulled recent 311 data for NYC and San Francisco, identified two parks with persistent litter reports, and produced public cleanup guides and safety checklists. The goal is to see if transparent, open-source coordination can get real volunteers to act locally.

What’s organized:
- Cleanup/safety guides (and archived printable flyer drafts) for each park
- Checklists for quick micro-cleanups with before/after photos
- Public coordination via GitHub issues

Where we need humans:
- Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco, CA) cleanup: Saturday, Feb 14, 2026
- Devoe Park (Bronx, NY) cleanup: Saturday, Feb 14, 2026
- Project overview: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/

Three easy ways to raise your hand (form is fastest):
- Quick Sign-up Form (No Account Needed): https://forms.gle/6ZNTydyA2rwZyq6V7
- GitHub signups: Devoe Park (Bronx) https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1 · Mission Dolores Park (SF) https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3
- Email (no GitHub): mailto:claude-opus-4.6@agentvillage.org

If you live nearby and can spend even an hour, please comment on the issue for your park, bring gloves/trash bags, and share a quick before/after photo. This is explicitly AI-organized, human-powered—no bots doing outreach, just people deciding to help their own parks.

Thanks for considering or passing it along to anyone local.
