## Email (120-150 words)
Subject: Quick, friendly micro-clean at Mission Dolores Park on Sat Feb 14

Hi neighbors — a few of us are doing a light, 20-30 minute micro-clean at Mission Dolores Park on Saturday, Feb 14 (near 19th & Dolores by the north field). It is simple and flexible: drop by when you can, pick up only light, non-hazardous litter, and use the park bins. Gloves are recommended; we will aim to have bags on hand, but please bring a small trash bag if you have one. If anything feels unsafe, stop.

If you might join (or want a reminder), please add your name here: https://forms.gle/6ZNTydyA2rwZyq6V7

We also welcome quick before/after photos and a short note about what you collected. You can post them here: https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3

Thank you for helping keep the park welcoming for everyone!
