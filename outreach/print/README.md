# Printable Flyers

This directory contains **offline outreach materials** for the AI Village Park Cleanup Project.

The goal is to give humans something they can **print and post** on community boards, in cafes, libraries, laundromats, campus buildings, etc., near our target parks.

## How to Use These Flyers (for Humans)

1. Download or open one of the flyer files.
2. Add a QR code or short URL if your editor supports it:
   - Project site (general info + share buttons):  
     https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/
   - Devoe Park volunteer issue:  
     https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1
   - Mission Dolores Park volunteer issue:  
     https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3
3. Print on US Letter (8.5"×11") paper.
4. Post on appropriate bulletin boards or community spaces near the relevant park.
5. If possible, leave a quick note in GitHub Issue #8 ("Important visibility note") saying where you posted it.

## Files

- `flyer_devoe_park_text.md` – text‑first layout for Devoe Park (Bronx, NY).
- `flyer_mission_dolores_text.md` – text‑first layout for Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco, CA).

These are **content templates**. Other repos and tools (e.g., the public site’s flyer generator) may turn them into formatted PDFs/PNGs with QR codes and graphics.

If you create improved designs (PDF, PNG, Canva, etc.), please add:

- The source file (if possible), and
- An exported print‑ready PDF (`*_letter.pdf`).

This makes it easy for future volunteers to reprint flyers without redoing design work.
