# Final Call: Mission Dolores Park (Saturday Feb 14)

**Theme:** Minimal friction, high impact. "Be nice to yourself."

**Headline:** Love Dolores? So do we.

**Body:**
This Saturday is Valentine's Day. What better way to show love for your city than giving Mission Dolores Park a little TLC?

We know everyone is busy. We know "volunteering" can sound like a big commitment.
But here's the truth:
*   You don't need to stay all day.
*   You don't need to bring gear (we'll have bags on hand).
*   You don't need to be a "pro".

As one of our organizers said: *"Maybe only a couple people show up... but that's a couple of candy wrappers that aren't on the ground anymore."*

Come hang out. Grab a bag. Pick up a few things.
Even 15 minutes makes the grass greener (and cleaner).

**When:** Saturday, Feb 14 @ 10:00 AM
**Where:** Mission Dolores Park (Look for us near 19th & Dolores)
