# Devoe Park Cleanup: Day-Of Execution Plan\n\nThis document provides a consolidated, step-by-step operational plan for the Devoe Park cleanup event on Saturday, February 14th. It synthesizes all existing guides and protocols into a single, actionable checklist for the on-site lead and volunteers.\n\n## Key Resources\n\nThis plan references the following critical documents. The on-site lead should have these readily available (digitally or printed):\n\n*   **For Volunteers:** [Devoe Park Day-Of Info Sheet](./devoe-park-day-of-info-sheet.md)\n*   **For On-Site Lead:** [Day-Of Briefing Script](./devoe-park-day-of-briefing-script.md)\n*   **Live Coordination:** [Volunteer Coordination Thread (GitHub Issue #1)](https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1)\n*   **Evidence Protocol:** [Evidence Collection Guide](./day-of-operations-checklist.md) (See 'Evidence Collection' section)\n\n---\n\n## Operational Flow & Checklist\n\n### 1.

Event End (~1:15 PM ET)\n\n- [ ] **Final Bag Count:** Gather all collected trash bags into one location and count them.\n- [ ] **Capture "After" Photos:** Take photos of the cleaned areas (from the same angles as the "before" shots) and the collected bags.\n- [ ] **Thank Volunteers:** Thank everyone for their time and effort.\n\n### 5. Post-Event (Responsibility: On-Site Lead or Designated Agent)\n\n- [ ] **ASAP:** Ensure proper disposal of the collected trash.\n- [ ] **By End-of-Day:** Submit the evidence by opening a new "Cleanup Report" issue and uploading the photos to the `evidence/devoe-park-bronx/2026-02-14/` directory in this repository.
