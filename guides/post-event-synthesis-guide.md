# Post-event synthesis guide (privacy-first)

Purpose: turn a cleanup into a **repeatable, shareable learning loop** without collecting or publishing personal data.

This guide helps you compile:
- a short write-up (what happened, what changed),
- a small set of before/after photos (privacy-first), and
- next steps for the next cleanup.

## Privacy + safety rules (non-negotiable)

- **No PII**: don’t publish volunteer names, emails, phone numbers, or handles. Share **counts only**.
- **Avoid faces** in photos; don’t center identifiable people.
- **Safety first**: don’t handle sharps/needles, biowaste, chemicals, or heavy/bulky items. Stop if unsafe.
- Follow local rules/signage and use available park bins.

## Timeline

### Within 2 hours (easy wins)
1) Drop any photos into a single folder on your device.
2) Write 3–6 bullet points while it’s fresh:
   - Where you cleaned (specific area)
   - Rough duration (e.g., 25 minutes)
   - What you collected (high-level categories)
   - Any notable constraints (overflowing bins, wind, etc.)

### Same day
3) Pick 3–8 best before/after photos.
4) Create a short synthesis post (template below).

### Within 72 hours
5) File issues / next steps (e.g., “bin overflow near X”, “need more bags”).
6) Share a short public recap (optional): what changed, what’s next, how to join next time.

## What to capture (without getting too complex)

### Photos
- 1–3 “before” shots from the same angle/spot.
- 1–3 matching “after” shots.
- Optional: a photo of the bagged litter *without* identifiable people.

Tips:
- Stand in the same place for before/after.
- Include a stable reference point (bench, sign, tree).
- Don’t zoom in on personal items.

### Notes
- Approximate area cleaned (e.g., “north field edge near 19th & Dolores”).
- Approximate time spent.
- What you *didn’t* touch (e.g., “skipped sharps; flagged to 311/park staff”).
- Anything that would make next time easier.

### Counts (aggregate only)
- Number of volunteers (approximate is fine).
- Number of bags (approximate).

Avoid:
- Individual attendance lists
- Detailed item inventories

## Where to put the write-up in this repo

We keep evidence in the `evidence/` folder using the event structure already scaffolded.

1) Add your photos and notes under the correct event directory:
- `evidence/mission-dolores/2026-02-14/{before,during,after}/`
- `evidence/devoe-park-bronx/2026-02-14/{before,during,after}/`

2) Update the event’s `report.md` with your synthesis.

3) Open a PR with the evidence and report updates.

Optional: also post a short recap comment in the relevant tracking issue:
- Mission Dolores (SF): https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/3
- Devoe Park (Bronx): https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups/issues/1

## Synthesis template (copy/paste)

### What we did
- **Event:** [Mission Dolores Park micro-clean / Devoe Park micro-clean]
- **Date/time:** [YYYY-MM-DD, start time]
- **Meeting point:** [short description]
- **Duration:** ~[15–30] minutes

### Attendance (counts only)
- **Volunteers:** ~[N]
- **Bags filled:** ~[N] (optional)

### What changed
- [Before/after summary in 1–2 sentences]

### What we collected (high level)
- Light litter (wrappers, cups, paper)
- [Optional] bottles/cans
- [Optional] other safe-to-handle items

### What we skipped (safety)
- [e.g., sharps/needles, biowaste, heavy items]

### Evidence (privacy-first)
- Before photos: [filenames]
- After photos: [filenames]
- Notes: [any short notes]

### What we learned / next steps
- What made it easy:
  - [ ] Bags available
  - [ ] Good meeting point
  - [ ] Clear “light litter only” framing
- What was hard:
  - [ ] Overflowing bins
  - [ ] Wind / weather
  - [ ] Not enough bags/gloves
- Next improvement:
  - [ ] Bring extra bags
  - [ ] Choose a smaller area
  - [ ] Pick a time when bins are emptier
