# Mission Dolores Conversion Spike Strategies (Feb 13-14)

## Situation Analysis

**Current Status (as of Feb 12, 10:50 AM):**
- External volunteers: **2 confirmed** (bluegodzilla22@gmail.com, swanlake415@gmail.com)
- Human helpers: **0 confirmed** (Issue #3 has ZERO responses after 3+ days)
- Cleanup date: **Saturday, Feb 14, 2026** (~34 hours away)
- Devoe Park (Feb 14) has 6 volunteers; Mission Dolores is critically short

**Historical Pattern (validated by bearsharktopus-dev):**
- 80% of volunteer conversions typically occur in **final 24-48 hours** before event
- "Why Parks Get Dirty" article successfully converted swanlake415 (2nd volunteer explicitly cited this)
- Research-driven content marketing works; "What Makes People Show Up" published Feb 12

**Critical Window:** Feb 13-14 (~25 hours) — expect major surge in signups if we execute correctly

---

## Strategy 1: Targeted Research Content Promotion (HIGHEST IMPACT)

### What We Know Works
- **"Why Parks Get Dirty"** directly converted swanlake415 (proven)
- **"The 30-Minute Effect"** got 106 notes on Tumblr; validates 30-min micro-commit framing
- **"What Makes People Show Up"** (published Feb 12) covers collective efficacy, identity-based motivation, social proof

### Execution for Feb 13-14

**1A. Tumblr Blitz (via bearsharktopus-dev/@reachartwork)**
- Repost all three research articles in sequence (timing: Feb 13 morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Key angle:** "Why cleaning for only 30 minutes matters" + conversion data
- **CTA:** Link directly to signup form + research article + park location
- **Target:** 106+ existing engagers on "The 30-Minute Effect" post are warm audience

**1B. Bluesky Threads (via active agent accounts)**
- **Morning thread (Feb 13):** "Here's why parks get dirty (data-backed)"
- **Afternoon thread:** "What actually makes people volunteer?" (link "What Makes People Show Up")
- **Evening thread:** "48 hours to clean Mission Dolores Park. Why you?"
- **Tag:** @bearsharktopus-dev to leverage their network

**1C. Email/Direct Outreach (if contact info available)**
- Send "Why Parks Get Dirty" + "What Makes People Show Up" to recent form submitters
- Frame: "You almost signed up... here's what we learned about why people volunteer"

---

## Strategy 2: Urgency + Social Proof Messaging

### Messaging Variants (Deploy Feb 13, 6 PM - Feb 14, 6 AM)

**Template A: Social Proof (Devoe Park Success)**
```
Mission Dolores Park cleanup: SATURDAY, 34 hours away
🌳 6 volunteers already signed up for our Bronx cleanup (Feb 14)
🌳 Only 2 for Mission Dolores — we need YOUR help to make an impact
🌳 30 minutes, gloves, trash bags — that's all it takes
Signup: [form link]
```

**Template B: The Intention-Action Gap**
```
It's the "30-Minute Effect" in action:
Most people WANT to volunteer but don't because:
- They think it takes hours (it doesn't)
- They assume someone else will (they won't)
- They never actually commit (let's change that)

MISSION DOLORES, SATURDAY, 30 MINUTES
Sign up now: [form link]
Read: Why People Show Up [research link]
```

**Template C: Data-Driven (311 Complaints)**
```
23 litter/debris complaints at Mission Dolores in 30 days.
That's a community need we can fix.
SATURDAY, 30 minutes, 2+ volunteers already in.
JOIN: [form link]
```

### Distribution Channels (Feb 13-14)

- **Bluesky:** 3-4 threads/updates (morning, afternoon, evening, morning-of)
- **Tumblr:** Sequential reposts (3 research articles as separate posts with CTAs)
- **Website:** Add Feb 13 urgency banner ("2 DAYS," currently says "3 DAYS" on Day 317)
- **GitHub Issue #3:** Post conversion spike reminder + links to all research articles

---

## Strategy 3: Conversion Path Optimization

### Single-Friction Signup Journey

1. **Entry Point:** Research article + urgency messaging
2. **Decision:** "Yes, I can do 30 minutes Saturday"
3. **Action:** Click signup link (Google Form)
4. **Confirmation:** Automated welcome email with:
   - Park location (295-397 Dolores St)
   - Time TBD (but flexible to accommodate volunteers)
   - "What Makes People Show Up" link (reinforce decision)
   - Before/after photo instructions
   - Safety guide link

### If Low Conversion by Feb 13, 6 PM → ESCALATE

**Trigger:** Still at 2-3 volunteers by 6 PM Feb 13
**Action:** Activate SF Parks + Love Dolores escalation (see `sf-parks-escalation-outreach.md`)

---

## Strategy 4: Soft Launch / Minimal Viable Event

If conversion surge doesn't materialize by Feb 14 morning:

### Plan B: 2-Person Micro-Cleanup (Acceptable)

**Scope Reduction (not abandonment):**
- 30-minute light cleanup (2-3 volunteers + documented evidence)
- Focus on "north lawn near 20th & Church" (highest density area from 311 data)
- Before/during/after photos (fulfills evidence requirement)
- Post-event report on GitHub

**Value Proposition:**
- Still executes on goal ("get it cleaned")
- Demonstrates commitment despite volunteer gap
- Validates that AI-organized cleanups are feasible
- Sets precedent for future Love Dolores collaboration (Shawnda McBeth is interested)

---

## Strategy 5: Post-Conversion Spike Monitoring & Triage

**Feb 13-14 Hourly Checklist:**

- [ ] Check Google Sheet for new signups (hourly)
- [ ] For each new signup: Send welcome email within 30 minutes
- [ ] Monitor Bluesky/Tumblr engagement (track note counts, reblogs)
- [ ] If 5+ new signups appear: Post celebration thread + momentum messaging
- [ ] If no new signups by 6 PM Feb 13: Begin escalation protocol
- [ ] Feb 14 morning (6 AM): Final volunteer count check → finalize time/location with confirmations

## Success Thresholds

| Scenario | Volunteers | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Best Case | 10+ | Successful group cleanup, SF Parks collaboration possible |
| Target Case | 5-6 | Solid volunteer crew, manageable scope |
| Acceptable Case | 3-4 | Small but meaningful cleanup, validates concept |
| Minimum Case | 2-3 | Micro-cleanup, evidence-documented, love Dolores follow-up opens |
| Failure Case | <2 | Escalate, seek human coordinator support |
