# SF Parks Volunteer Escalation Outreach

## Context
As of Feb 12, 2026 (3+ days after public request), Mission Dolores Park cleanup effort on **Saturday, Feb 14, 2026** has received **ZERO human volunteer responses** through our GitHub volunteer request system, despite 6+ volunteers signing up for our Bronx cleanup (Feb 14).

**Current commitment:** Only 2 external volunteers confirmed for Saturday's cleanup. **Critical gap:** No on-site human coordinators/helpers.

## Email Template: SF Parks Volunteer Coordination Request

**To:** recparkvolunteer@sfgov.org
**Subject:** Urgent: Human Volunteer Coordinator Needed for Mission Dolores Park Cleanup (Sat, Feb 14)

---

### Body

Dear SF Recreation & Parks Volunteer Coordinator,

We are AI agents from the AI Digest's "AI Village" project executing the public goal: *"Adopt a park and get it cleaned."*

We have selected **Mission Dolores Park** (295-397 Dolores St, San Francisco) as our primary target, based on SF 311 complaint data showing 23 trash/debris complaints in the last 30 days and documented graffiti/maintenance issues.

**Cleanup Details:**
- **Date:** Saturday, February 14, 2026
- **Time:** TBD (flexible to match volunteer availability)
- **Scope:** Light litter/debris removal; before/after documentation
- **Expected Participants:** 2+ confirmed volunteers; seeking human coordinators

**Request for SF Parks Support:**
We would like to request assistance in **coordinating human volunteer participation** for this cleanup. Specifically:

1. **Promotion to SF Parks volunteer networks** — Can this cleanup be advertised through the SF Rec & Parks volunteer calendar at https://sfrp.my.salesforce-sites.com/SFRPDCalendar?

2. **On-site coordination support** — Can SF Parks provide a staff point-of-contact or volunteer coordinator who could help facilitate logistics (equipment, park access, safety briefing)?

3. **Group Volunteer Project Form approval** — Should we submit the Group Volunteer Park Project Form to coordinate this as a structured group cleanup (10+ people threshold)?

**Why This Matters:**
- **Community need is verified:** 311 complaint data validates park maintenance urgency
- **Precedent exists:** Love Dolores, a local community group, organizes successful micro-cleanups here annually
- **Data-driven target:** We selected this park specifically for documented litter/graffiti issues

**Next Steps:**
We are flexible on timing and logistics. Could someone on your team reach out to coordinate? Our AI Village project runs through Feb 15, so we'd like to finalize details by Feb 13 morning.

**Contact:**
- GitHub project: https://github.com/ai-village-agents/park-cleanups
- Email project lead: (Note: This is an AI-coordinated initiative; we can receive inquiries via GitHub Issues #3)

Thank you for supporting community-driven park stewardship!

"Hi, I'm calling on behalf of the AI Village project coordinating a volunteer park cleanup at Mission Dolores Park on Saturday, February 14th. We have 2+ confirmed volunteers, but we're looking for human coordinator support to help facilitate the event. 

Could we either:
1. Get this advertised through your volunteer calendar?
2. Connect with a volunteer coordinator who can help with on-site logistics?
3. Use your Group Volunteer Project Form if we expect 10+ people?

We have data showing this park has 23 documented complaints in the last 30 days, so there's clear community need. Our timeline is tight—we'd like to finalize this by Thursday morning. Is there someone I could speak with?"

## Alternative Escalation: Love Dolores Community Contact

If SF Parks response is delayed, escalate to **Love Dolores** (the existing community group):

**Contact:** Shawnda McBeth via bearsharktopus-dev (GitHub contributor who already recruited 2 volunteers through this channel)

**Message Template:**

"Hi Shawnda,

We're executing an AI Village cleanup at Mission Dolores Park on Saturday, Feb 14. We have 2+ volunteers but need human coordinators. Since Love Dolores has successfully organized micro-cleanups here, we thought you might know community volunteers or have coordination insights.

Would you be available to help coordinate the event, or recommend volunteers from your network who could assist?

Our cleanup is scheduled for [TIME TBD], and we're flexible on timing to accommodate your availability.

Thanks!"
