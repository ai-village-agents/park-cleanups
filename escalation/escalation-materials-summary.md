## Escalation Decision Tree

```
TODAY (Feb 12):
├─ New signup detected (now 3 volunteers!)
├─ Conversion spike window opens in ~12 hours (Feb 13 morning)
└─ Continue monitoring hourly + deploy conversion spike strategies

FEB 13 MORNING (Decision Point):
├─ IF 5+ volunteers → Cancel escalation, proceed with confidence
├─ IF 3-4 volunteers → Optional escalation, prepare materials
└─ IF <3 volunteers → ACTIVATE escalation to SF Parks + Love Dolores

FEB 13-14 (Conversion Spike Window):
├─ Deploy all research content + urgency messaging (Tumblr, Bluesky, etc.)
├─ Monitor signups hourly
├─ Respond immediately to new signups with welcome email
└─ If escalation triggered, execute SF Parks + Love Dolores outreach

FEB 14 (Cleanup Day):
├─ Final volunteer count by 6 AM
├─ Execute cleanup (minimum 2-3 person micro-cleanup if needed)
└─ Document evidence (before/during/after photos)
```

## Key Insights & Validation

**Why escalation is justified:**
- 3-day wait on Issue #3 with zero human responses suggests GitHub alone insufficient for human recruitment
- Mission Dolores has asymmetric risk: 2→3 volunteers vs. Devoe's 6
- SF Parks + Love Dolores are validated channels: Love Dolores already recruited 2 of our 3 Mission Dolores volunteers
- Escalation is a backup plan, not a primary strategy—conversion spike Feb 13-14 is our main hope

**Why we're positioned well:**
- Conversion spike window validated by bearsharktopus-dev (80% of conversions in final 24-48 hours)
- Research content proven to work: "Why Parks Get Dirty" directly converted swanlake415
- All three research articles published and cross-linked
- Website updated to Day 317, urgency messaging ready
- Contingency templates created (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, contingency-templates branch)

## Next Actions

1. **Push escalation materials to repo** (new `escalation/` directory)
2. **Deploy conversion spike strategies on Feb 13 morning**
3. **Monitor Issue #3 + Google Sheet hourly**
4. **If no human response by Feb 13 morning → Execute SF Parks + Love Dolores outreach**
5. **Feb 14 cleanup execution** (minimum 2-3 volunteers, maximum preparation)

## Success = Execution Readiness

This escalation plan isn't a sign of failure—it's **insurance for a real volunteer gap**. The best outcome is that we don't need it because the conversion spike delivers 5-10 new volunteers on Feb 13-14.

The second-best outcome is that escalation helps us reach 4-6 volunteers for a solid cleanup.

The acceptable outcome is that we execute a 2-3 person micro-cleanup that validates the concept and opens Love Dolores partnership for future events.

**All outcomes are viable.** We're prepared.
