# Park Cleanup Recruitment Funnel Analysis
## Day 314 (February 9, 2026) - 1:35 PM PT

### Current Status
- **Goal**: Recruit human volunteers for park cleanups on Feb 14-15 (5-6 days away)
- **Target Locations**: Devoe Park (Bronx, NYC) & Mission Dolores Park (San Francisco)
- **Success Metric**: External volunteers commenting on GitHub Issues #1 & #3

### Channel Performance (as of 1:35 PM PT)

#### 1. Twitter/X (Most Promising)
- **Accounts Active**: @sonnet4_5_ (Claude Sonnet 4.5), @claude_37_ (Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
- **Posts Made**: ~20 minutes ago (1:09 PM PT announcement)
- **Visibility**: Unknown (403 network block prevents verification)
- **External Feedback**: Minuteandone reports "It doesn't seem like anyone has posted the thread yet"
- **Potential Issues**: New accounts, possible shadowban, low reach
- **Next Check**: Monitor GitHub issues for referral traffic

#### 2. GitHub Issues (Primary Sign-up Channel)
- **Issue #1 (Devoe Park)**: 0 external comments (all AI Village agent comments)
- **Issue #3 (Mission Dolores)**: 0 external comments (all AI Village agent comments)
- **Monitoring**: Automated workflow running hourly, filters 12 agent logins
- **Alerting**: Will post notification comment if external comment detected

#### 3. Website & Flyers

- **Response Rate**: 0 responses so far

#### 5. Community Organizations

- **Status**: No replies yet
- **Restriction**: Cannot send unsolicited follow-ups

#### 6. Volunteer Platforms (Blocked)
- **Attempted**: VolunteerMatch, Idealist, Meetup.com
- **Status**: Account creation required → Network blocked (403)
- **Workaround**: None available for AI agents

### Critical Path Analysis
1. **Twitter is our only active outreach channel** that can reach humans directly
2. **Time sensitivity**: 5-6 days until cleanup weekend
3. **Bottleneck**: Human awareness → volunteer commitment
4. **Verification gap**: Cannot verify Twitter post visibility/reach

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate (Next 24 hours)**:
   - Monitor GitHub issues for external comments hourly
   - If possible, have human staff verify Twitter post visibility
   - Consider asking AI Digest staff to amplify tweets

2. **Medium-term (Days 1-3)**:
   - If no volunteers by Day 315, escalate to human helpers
   - Prepare contingency: smaller-scale cleanup with available humans
   - Document lessons for future community projects

3. **Documentation**:
   - Track all outreach attempts and responses
   - Analyze conversion rates for future reference
   - Update runbooks for volunteer triage

### Metrics to Track
- **External comments on Issues #1 & #3** (primary KPI)
- **Website traffic** (if analytics available)
- **Flyer downloads** (GitHub raw file access counts)
- **Time to first volunteer** (currently: ∞)

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Zero volunteer sign-ups by Feb 13
- **Medium Risk**: Low volunteer turnout (1-2 per park)
- **Low Risk**: Adequate volunteers (3+ per park)
