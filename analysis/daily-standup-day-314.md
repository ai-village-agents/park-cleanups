# Daily Standup - Day 314 (Feb 9, 2026)

## Today's Goal
Adopt a park and get it cleaned! (Specifically: recruit human volunteers for Feb 14-15 cleanups)

## Progress Today

### Infrastructure Completed
1. **Monitoring System**: Automated GitHub Issues monitor (PR #9 merged)
   - Tracks Issues #1 (Devoe Park) and #3 (Mission Dolores)
   - Filters 12 AI Village agent logins, alerts only on external comments
   - Hourly cron schedule (runs at minute 0)
   - Last successful run: Run #14 at 1:19 PM PT

2. **Project Website**: https://ai-village-agents.github.io/park-cleanup-site/
   - Complete with "Spread the Word" section
   - Share buttons (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook)
   - Printable flyers (3 PDFs + 3 PNGs with QR codes)
   - Park-specific information and 311 data visualizations

3. **Recruitment Channels Established**:
   - GitHub Issues (#1, #3) as primary sign-up
   - Twitter accounts: @sonnet4_5_ and @claude_37_ (posts made ~1:09 PM PT)
   - Email templates for park organizations
   - Community outreach guide with physical locations

### Outreach Attempts
- **Twitter**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet posted about cleanups
- **Email**: Sent to NYC Partnerships for Parks & SF Recreation & Parks Volunteer Program
- **Community Organizations**: Contacted "Friends of Devoe Park" & "Mission Dolores Neighborhood Association"
- **Website**: Live with share buttons and flyer downloads

### Current Status (as of 1:40 PM PT)
- **Issues #1 & #3**: 0 external volunteer comments (all comments from AI Village agents)
- **Twitter Visibility**: Unknown (403 network block prevents verification)
- **Email Responses**: 0 replies received
- **Time Remaining**: 5-6 days until cleanup weekend (Feb 14-15)

## Critical Blockers
1. **Network Restrictions**: Cannot verify Twitter post visibility/reach
2. **Account Creation**: Cannot create accounts on volunteer platforms (VolunteerMatch, Meetup, etc.)
3. **Human Amplification**: Need humans to share website/flyers in their communities

## Tomorrow's Priorities (Day 315)
1. **Monitor Volunteer Sign-ups**: Check Issues #1 & #3 for external comments
2. **Escalate if Needed**: If no volunteers by Day 315, request human helper assistance
3. **Verify Twitter Impact**: Ask AI Digest staff to check tweet visibility
4. **Prepare Contingency**: Plan for smaller-scale cleanup if low volunteer turnout

## Key Metrics
- **Primary KPI**: External comments on Issues #1 & #3
- **Secondary**: Website traffic, flyer downloads
- **Time to first volunteer**: Currently ∞

## Risk Assessment
- **High**: Zero volunteer sign-ups by Feb 13
- **Medium**: Low turnout (1-2 per park)  
- **Low**: Adequate volunteers (3+ per park)
