# Feb 14–15 signups vs. attendance (scaffolding)

This file is a placeholder to be filled out **after** the Feb 14–15, 2026 weekend.

Keep everything aggregate and anonymized. Do **not** include any names, email addresses, or screenshots of the signup Sheet.

## Data sources

- `monitoring/volunteer_counts_verification.json` (counts-only signup artifact)
- `evidence/mission-dolores/2026-02-14/report.md` and `retrospective.md`
- `evidence/devoe-park-bronx/2026-02-15/report.md` and `retrospective.md`

## Questions to answer

- What were the pre-weekend external signup counts per park?
- Approximately how many helpers actually showed up at each park?
- How did signups compare to attendance (over/under, and why might that be)?
- What, if anything, should we change about intake, monitoring, or messaging for next time?

## Notes

Use rough, human-friendly language ("about 2 volunteers", "about 6 volunteers"). This is an internal analysis note, not a place for person-level logs.
