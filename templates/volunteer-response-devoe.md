Hi @[USERNAME]!

 **Thank you so much for volunteering to help with the Devoe Park cleanup!** We're thrilled to have your support.

## Next Steps

### 1. Review Safety Guidelines
Before heading out, please review our **[Volunteer Safety Guide](../safety.md)** which covers:
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements
- Sharps handling procedures (critical for NYC parks)
- Emergency protocols and contact information

### 2. Plan Your Cleanup Visit

**Location:** Devoe Park, W 188th St & University Ave, Bronx, NY 10468

**Getting There:**
- Take the 4 train to Fordham Rd, then walk west on Fordham Rd and south on University Ave to W 188th St (park entrance).
- Take the Bx12 or Bx3 bus to University Ave & W 188th St.

**What to Bring:**
- Heavy-duty gloves (leather or cut-resistant)
- Trash bags (heavy-duty 30-55 gallon recommended)
- Grabber/picker tool (optional but helpful)
- Water and snacks for yourself
- Phone for taking photos

**NYC Cleanup Resources:**
- NYC Parks "Adopt-a-Park" program: [nycparks.org/opportunities/volunteer](https://www.nycparks.org/opportunities/volunteer)
- Sanitation Foundation "Adopt Your Spot NYC" offers free cleanup kits: [sanitationfoundation.org](https://www.sanitationfoundation.org/)

### 3. Document Your Cleanup

We need strong evidence to verify the cleanup was completed. Please collect:

#### Before Photos (REQUIRED):
- Wide shots of the areas you plan to clean
- Close-ups of specific problem spots (litter, debris piles, etc.)
- Photos should include visible landmarks for location verification
- Include timestamp if your camera supports it

#### During Cleanup:
- Count your trash bags as you fill them
- If possible, weigh them (or estimate: typical full bag = 20-30 lbs)
- Note what you collected (general litter, bottles/cans, bulky items, etc.)
- Take progress photos

#### After Photos (REQUIRED):
- **Take photos from the same angles/positions as your "before" photos** - this is critical for verification!
- Wide shots showing the cleaned areas
- Close-ups of previously problematic spots now cleaned
- Final bag count photo (all filled bags together)

#### Additional Documentation:
- Date and time of cleanup
- Number of volunteers who participated
- Total time spent
- Disposal method (placed in park trash bins, left for NYC Sanitation pickup, etc.)
- Any NYC Parks Department confirmation if you coordinated with them

### 4. Submit Your Evidence

We offer **two paths** for evidence submission (choose whichever is easier for you):

**Path A - Simple Submission (Easiest):**
1. Upload your photos to a photo album service (Google Photos, Imgur, Flickr, etc.)
2. Share the album link in a comment on this Issue
3. Include your bag count, date, time, and disposal method in the comment

**Path B - Full GitHub Submission (For experienced GitHub users):**
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a folder: `evidence/devoe-park-bronx/[YYYY-MM-DD]/`
3. Add your photos and a `report.md` file (use our [cleanup report template](../templates/cleanup-report-template.md))
4. Submit a Pull Request

Either path is perfectly acceptable! We just need clear before/after photos and basic metrics.

### 5. Safety Reminders

 **Important Safety Notes:**
- **Never handle sharps (needles, syringes, broken glass)** - do not pick them up; report them to 311 or park staff.
- Work in daylight hours (avoid dawn/dusk)
- Ideally work with a buddy or let someone know where you'll be
- If you encounter encampments or people sleeping, **do not disturb them** - clean around them respectfully
- If you see anything concerning, contact NYPD non-emergency: 311
