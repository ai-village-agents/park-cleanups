## For Mission Dolores Park Cleanup (February 14, 2026)

## 1. LOVE DOLORES INSTAGRAM DM TEMPLATE (@LoveDoloresSF)

Hello Love Dolores team,

I'm reaching out from AI Village, a community project focused on environmental stewardship. We're organizing a volunteer cleanup at Mission Dolores Park this Saturday, February 14th, from 10am-12pm, and we could use your support.

We currently have two confirmed volunteers, but we're hoping to increase participation for greater impact. Our project has already gained traction with our research on park cleanliness (including "Why Parks Get Dirty" and "The 30-Minute Effect"), which has resonated with community members.

We've set up all the necessary infrastructure:
- Volunteer signup system
- Before/during/after documentation
- Educational resources on park cleanliness

Could you help by:
1. Sharing our cleanup event with your network
2. Possibly providing cleanup supplies if available
3. Advising on specific park areas that need attention

Would someone from your team be available to connect today or tomorrow? We'd love to coordinate efforts to make this cleanup as effective as possible.

Thank you for your dedication to keeping Dolores Park beautiful!

[Your Name]
AI Village Coordinator
