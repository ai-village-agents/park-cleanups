# Post-cleanup newsletter snippet template

> Maintainer notes (do not include in the final newsletter):
> - This is a short, public-facing recap block for a newsletter or update email.
> - Base all numbers on the event report.md and retrospective.md plus vetted photos.
> - Use approximate counts only ("about six volunteers," "roughly three bags").
> - Do not include names, email addresses, phone numbers, social handles, or identifiable photos.
> - Do not mention or show volunteers handling sharps or medical waste. Volunteers do **not** handle sharps.
> - If you link to photos or a public writeup, make sure those also follow our privacy and non-carceral norms.
>
> Suggested inputs:
> - Park, city, and date (for example: Devoe Park, Bronx, NY — February 14, 2026)
> - Approximate volunteer count and volunteer-hours
> - Approximate number of bags and main trash categories
> - One or two specific areas that felt different afterward (by landmarks, not precise addresses)
> - One short sentence about safety and respect practices (no-sharps, 311 or park staff, clean trash, not people)
> - One sentence about what you learned or might change next time

## Short newsletter snippet (around 80–120 words)

On [CLEANUP_DATE], about [APPROX_VOLUNTEERS] of us spent roughly [APPROX_HOURS] hours picking up litter at [PARK_NAME] in [CITY]. We focused on [MAIN_AREAS_BY_LANDMARK] and filled about [APPROX_BAGS] bags, mostly [MAIN_TRASH_TYPES] and other everyday trash.

We avoided sharps and other hazards, marking anything risky for [CITY_311_OR_PARKS_CHANNEL] or park staff instead. We also cleaned around people and belongings without disturbing them. Our goal is to clean trash, not people.

The biggest visible changes were around [NOTABLE_SPOT_OR_LANDMARK]. It is a small first step, but it made the park feel a bit better to walk through.

## Optional slightly longer version (around 150–220 words)

On [CLEANUP_DATE], about [APPROX_VOLUNTEERS] volunteers spent roughly [APPROX_HOURS] hours doing a small cleanup at [PARK_NAME] in [CITY]. We met near [MEETUP_LANDMARK] and worked mostly around [WORK_AREAS_BY_LANDMARKS]. By the end we had filled about [APPROX_BAGS] bags of trash, mostly [MAIN_TRASH_TYPES] plus a mix of cans, bottles, and food packaging.

We followed a strict no-sharps policy: volunteers did **not** pick up needles, medical waste, or anything that seemed risky. Instead, we noted locations and left hazards for [CITY_311_OR_PARKS_CHANNEL] or park staff to handle. We also avoided moving tents, carts, or personal belongings and cleaned around people instead of treating anyone as a problem to be cleaned up.

The most noticeable changes were around [NOTABLE_SPOT_OR_LANDMARK], where paths and sitting areas had much less scattered trash. It is a modest improvement, but it made the park feel a bit more cared for.

From here, we are using the notes, photos, and a short retrospective to decide what to repeat, what to change, and how to plan a next round that stays safe, respectful, and realistic about what a few hours of volunteer time can do.
