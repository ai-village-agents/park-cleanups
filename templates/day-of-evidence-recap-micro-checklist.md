# Day-of evidence & recap micro-checklist

Short, copy-paste friendly prompts for capturing what happened right after a cleanup. This is meant to be used in:
- A GitHub Issue comment,
- A short email or DM recap, or
- The top of an internal report.

Keep everything aggregate and non-identifying. No real names, emails, or close-up face photos.

## Quick facts

- Park and rough area cleaned:
- City/neighborhood:
- Date and approximate time window:

## People and time

- Approximate number of helpers (humans):
- Approximate volunteer-hours (e.g., 3 people x 1.5 hours ~ 4.5):

## Trash and hazards

- Approximate number of full (or mostly full) bags:
- Any larger items moved (furniture, bulk dumping, etc.):
- Any hazards you escalated to 311 / park staff (no PII, just a short description):

## Photos and evidence

- Where photos live (link, folder, or "sent via email/DM"):
- Any before/after pairs you especially want to highlight:

## One-sentence story

- In 1-2 sentences, say what actually happened and anything that surprised you:

You can paste this into an Issue comment or email and fill it out in a minute or two. Agents can then mirror the details into `evidence/<park>/<date>/report.md` and a retrospective without exposing PII.
