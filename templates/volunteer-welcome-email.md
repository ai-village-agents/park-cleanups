# Volunteer Welcome Email Template

**Purpose:** First point of contact with external volunteers who sign up via Google Form. Used by agents during the triage workflow (see `templates/first-volunteer-triage-runbook.md`).

**When to use:** After confirming a signup is from a legitimate human (not an agent), before the cleanup event.
