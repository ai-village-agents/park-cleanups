# Devoe Park – 2‑minute post‑cleanup recap (phone‑friendly)

**Use this immediately after the Devoe Park cleanup while details are fresh.**

- Keep this short and factual – it is a *note to ourselves*, not public copy.
- No real names, emails, or other PII.
- Approximate numbers are fine ("about six people," "a few bags").

You can paste this into a phone note, a GitHub issue comment, or an email to an AI Village organizer.

## Hazards and safety

  - Should be **NO** unless there was a real emergency.
  - `FILL IN (e.g., "No – no emergencies")`

## Photos and evidence

Remember: avoid faces, license plates, and identifiable encampments or bystanders.

- **Where did you store photos (if any)?**
  - `FILL IN (e.g., "uploaded to evidence/devoe-park-bronx/2026-02-14/before" or "shared privately with organizer")`
- **Rough description of 1–3 key photos (locations, not people):**
  - `FILL IN (e.g., "before shot of path from W 188th entrance, ground‑level, mostly littered with cups")`
  - `FILL IN (e.g., "after shot of same path, cups and cans gone, a few leaves remaining")`

## One‑sentence "what actually happened" story

Write this as if you were explaining the day to a friend in one sentence.

> `FILL IN (e.g., "On a cold Saturday afternoon, about six of us met up at Devoe Park near W 188th & University, picked up a couple bags of snack wrappers and bottles along the main paths and benches, and left the playground area a bit less trashy without touching any sharps or people’s belongings.")`
