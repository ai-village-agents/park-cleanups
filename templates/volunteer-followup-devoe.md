# Devoe Park Volunteer Follow-Up Email Template (Post-Cleanup)

Purpose: Thank Devoe Park volunteers after the Feb 14 cleanup, share what we know so far, invite reflections and photos, and offer low-pressure ways to stay involved. This template is written to keep our **safety**, **non-carceral**, and **privacy** commitments front and center.

Hi [VOLUNTEER_NAME],

Thank you again for showing up for the Devoe Park cleanup on Saturday. It meant a lot to have you there.

## What you helped make happen

We are still pulling together the full report, but here is what we know so far:

- **Where:** Devoe Park (W 188th St & University Ave, Bronx, NY)
- **When:** Saturday, February 14, 2026, roughly 12:00–2:00 PM
- **Who:** At least [ESTIMATED_VOLUNTEER_COUNT] volunteers (including you!)
- **What changed:** [SHORT_ONE_SENTENCE_IMPACT_SUMMARY]

We will publish an anonymized writeup later (no real names, faces, or identifying details) so people can see what a small, focused cleanup can do.

## Optional: reflections and photos

If you have a few minutes, we would love to hear how the cleanup felt from your perspective. Totally optional, but helpful:

- 1–3 sentences about what the day was like for you
- Anything that felt especially easy, hard, or surprising
- Any suggestions for how we could make the next cleanup smoother or more welcoming

If you took photos and are comfortable sharing them, you can either reply with a link (Google Photos, Imgur, etc.) or attach a couple of images. To respect privacy and safety:

- Please avoid sending photos with visible faces, license plates, or clearly identifiable encampments if you can
- If any photos do include you or friends and you are OK with us using them in anonymized reports or future writeups, please say so explicitly in your reply

If you would rather not be quoted or have your photos used at all, that is completely fine too — just let us know.

## Safety and how we talk about the park

As a reminder, our project is about **cleaning up trash and supporting shared spaces**, not about policing who belongs in the park:

- Volunteers should not handle needles, syringes, dangerous broken glass, or medical/biological waste; those are hazards to avoid and report, not trash to bag
- We do not move or discard tents, carts, bags, bedding, or other personal belongings
- We do not call police just because someone is present, unhoused, or looks like they might be struggling
- Emergency services (including 911) are only for **real safety or medical emergencies**

If anything about how the cleanup felt on this front was uncomfortable or off to you, we would be grateful to hear it so we can improve.

## Staying in the loop (optional)

If you would like to hear about future small park cleanups or see the anonymized Devoe Park writeup once it is ready, you can:

- Stay subscribed to the newsletter you originally found us through, or
- Reply and let us know you are interested in future Bronx / NYC cleanups

No pressure either way — showing up once already helped more than you might think.

Thank you again for taking the time and care to help clean up Devoe Park.

## Customization Notes

- `[VOLUNTEER_NAME]` can be a first name or "there" if you are unsure ("Hi there,").
- `[ESTIMATED_VOLUNTEER_COUNT]` should come from the Devoe report (e.g., "5" or "7–8").
- `[SHORT_ONE_SENTENCE_IMPACT_SUMMARY]` is a simple statement like:
  - "We filled around 3 big trash bags worth of litter from the paths and fence lines."
  - "We focused on the paths near the playground and benches and pulled out a surprising amount of cans and wrappers."
- Keep replies **aggregate and anonymized** if you quote anything later (no names, no specific personal stories tied to identities).
