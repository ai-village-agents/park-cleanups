# Public post‑cleanup writeup template

**Purpose:** Turn internal evidence (quick recap, `report.md`, `retrospective.md`, photos) for a *single* cleanup into a modest, privacy‑preserving public story (blog post, static page, or newsletter section).

- No real names, emails, or contact info for volunteers.
- Avoid faces, license plates, and identifiable encampments in any linked photos.
- Use **approximate** counts and bag numbers.
- Emphasize: we **clean trash, not people**; volunteers **do not** handle sharps or medical/biological waste.

You can copy this into `articles/`, a site page, or a newsletter draft and fill in the blanks.

> **Note:** Adjust park/date details below to match the specific event. Example placeholders assume Devoe Park in the Bronx on Saturday, February 14, 2026, around 12–2 PM ET.

## 1. Title and subtitle

**Working title (short and concrete):**

> `FILL IN (e.g., "A cold Saturday cleanup at Devoe Park in the Bronx")`

**Optional subtitle (one line of context):**

> `FILL IN (e.g., "A small group spent a couple of hours picking up litter along the main paths and benches.")`

---

## 2. What this cleanup was

In this section, briefly answer: **where, when, who (approx), and why here?**

> `FILL IN PARAGRAPH (3–6 sentences)`
>
> - Park and location by landmarks (e.g., "Devoe Park in the Bronx, near the W 188th St & University Ave entrance").
> - Date and approximate time (e.g., "Saturday, February 14, 2026, around noon to early afternoon").
> - Approximate number of people (e.g., "about six volunteers"), no names.
> - A sentence about why this park/spot matters (e.g., "busy neighborhood park with a lot of foot traffic and litter buildup along the main paths and benches").
> - If relevant, a short note that this was our first in‑person cleanup at this park.

Example opening:

> `Example: "On a cold Saturday in mid‑February, about six of us met up at Devoe Park in the Bronx near the W 188th Street and University Avenue entrance for a small, first‑time cleanup. Devoe is a busy neighborhood park with a lot of day‑to‑day foot traffic, and we focused on the spots where litter collects fastest: the main paths, benches, and edges near the playground and fence line."`

## 3. What we actually did

Summarize **areas covered, time spent, and approximate trash collected**, using honest, non‑dramatic language.

> `FILL IN PARAGRAPH(S)`
>
> - Rough time window (planned vs actual if notable).
> - Main areas worked, described via landmarks (e.g., entrances, benches, playground edge, fence line), not street addresses of individuals.
> - Approximate number and size of bags (e.g., "about two medium bags of mostly snack wrappers, cups, and bottles").
> - A few specific but non‑gory examples of what you picked up.
> - Approximate volunteer‑hours (e.g., "around 10–12 volunteer‑hours in total").

Example phrasing:

> `Example: "We spent roughly two hours walking the main central path from the W 188th entrance, the benches near the playground, and the fence line along the University Avenue side. By the end, we had filled about two medium bags with mostly snack wrappers, cups, and plastic bottles, plus a few bulkier items like broken umbrella pieces and cardboard. With six people staying for most of the time, that added up to roughly 10–12 volunteer‑hours."`

## 4. Safety, respect, and what we *didn’t* do

Reinforce our norms: **no sharps handling, no disturbing people’s belongings, and no carceral framing.**

> `FILL IN PARAGRAPH (2–5 sentences)`
>
> - State clearly that volunteers **did not** handle needles, syringes, medical/biological waste, or dangerous glass.
> - If hazards were present, briefly note how they were handled: marked and avoided, and if appropriate, reported to park staff or NYC 311; 911 only if there had been a true emergency.
> - Affirm that volunteers did not move tents, carts, bedding, or personal belongings, and that the goal was to clean trash *around* where people live and spend time, not to "clean up" people.
> - Use non‑carceral, neighbor‑respectful language.

Example phrasing:

> `Example: "We kept to a simple safety rule: volunteers don’t pick up needles, medical waste, or anything that feels unsafe to handle. When we saw a small number of sharp or questionable items, we marked and avoided those spots and, where it made sense, noted them for park staff or NYC 311 instead of trying to deal with them ourselves. We also did not move tents, carts, or other personal belongings – the point of the day was to pick up litter around where people already are, not to displace anyone or involve the police."`

## 5. How the park felt before and after

Describe **visible changes and how the space felt**, without exaggeration.

> `FILL IN PARAGRAPH (3–6 sentences)`
>
> - One or two sentences on what the key areas looked like before (e.g., "cups and bottles scattered along the main entrance path").
> - One or two sentences on how they looked after (e.g., "path mostly clear except for leaves and a few stubborn pieces").
> - Optional note on how it felt to be there during/after (e.g., quieter, a little less cluttered, more welcoming).
> - Keep claims small and believable (e.g., "a bit cleaner," "noticeably less trash in the worst spots").

Example phrasing:

> `Example: "When we arrived, the entrance path and benches near the playground had a familiar mix of cups, cans, and snack wrappers scattered underfoot. By the time we packed up, those same paths and benches looked a bit less cluttered – most of the obvious trash was gone, leaving leaves, dirt, and everyday wear behind. It didn’t transform the whole park, but it did make the spots we focused on feel a little more cared‑for for anyone walking through later that day."`

## 6. What we learned for next time

Turn the internal retrospective into 1–3 short paragraphs about **lessons and follow‑ups**.

> `FILL IN BULLETS OR PARAGRAPH(S)`
>
> - Planning/logistics (e.g., "we needed more gloves in smaller sizes," "meeting at a clear landmark helped").
> - Working with park systems (e.g., any 311 requests, staff interactions, or questions about trash pickup schedules).
> - Timing and scale (e.g., whether two hours felt right, whether it might be better to aim smaller or larger areas next time).
> - Anything you want to adjust for accessibility, communication, or safety.

Example content:

> `Example: "A couple of small lessons stood out. We could have used more gloves in smaller sizes and an extra roll of sturdy trash bags. Having a clear meetup landmark at W 188th and University made it easier for people to find us, and sticking to a two‑hour window felt reasonable for a first cleanup in cold weather. For next time, we want to plan roles a bit more (who’s tracking bags, who’s taking before/after photos) and get clearer on how quickly full bags are usually picked up from Devoe so we can leave them in the right place."`

## 7. How to get involved (optional section)

If this is going onto a public site or newsletter, you can add a short, gentle invitation for future participation.

> `FILL IN SHORT PARAGRAPH (2–4 sentences)`
>
> - Suggest that people can join future small cleanups if and when they happen.
> - Encourage solo or very small‑group cleanups that follow the same safety and respect guidelines.
> - Include a neutral way to stay informed (e.g., link to a main info page or newsletter), not a personal email address.

Example phrasing:

> `Example: "If you’d like to join a future cleanup like this, we’ll post updates on our main info page and through our newsletter. You can also do a small, informal cleanup on your own or with a couple of friends if you feel safe doing so – just remember our basics: don’t handle sharps or medical waste, don’t disturb people’s belongings, and aim for small, honest improvements rather than dramatic before‑and‑after photos."`

## 8. Notes for maintainers (do not publish)

Use this quick checklist before publishing or merging.

- [ ] **Correct park and date:** All mentions of park, city, and date match the actual event (e.g., "Devoe Park, Bronx, Saturday, February 14, 2026").
- [ ] **Correct time window:** Time references are consistent (e.g., "around 12–2 PM ET"), and do **not** mention any canceled or hypothetical events.
- [ ] **Approximate, honest counts:** Volunteer counts and bag numbers are approximate and match internal evidence within reasonable bounds.
- [ ] **No PII:** No real names, emails, or other personally identifying details for volunteers or bystanders.
- [ ] **Privacy‑safe photos:** Any linked photos avoid faces, license plates, and identifiable encampments or bystanders.
- [ ] **Sharps and hazard policy:** Text makes it clear that volunteers do **not** handle sharps, medical/biological waste, or other high‑risk items, and describes hazards as marked/escalated, not cleaned by hand.
- [ ] **Non‑carceral framing:** There is no "crackdown" or "sweep" framing; we emphasize cleaning trash, not people, and reserve 911 for emergencies only.
- [ ] **Modest impact claims:** No exaggerated language about "transforming" the park – impact is framed as small, concrete improvements.
- [ ] **Internal references:** If this writeup depends on specific `report.md`, `retrospective.md`, or evidence directories, the paths are correct for this park/date.
