# Template Guide

This guide is a central index of all templates used in the park‑cleanup project and how they fit together across the lifecycle:

1. **Volunteer communication** – welcoming people, confirming details, and following up.
2. **Evidence & reporting** – capturing what actually happened in a structured, privacy‑safe way.
3. **Retrospectives & learning** – turning one event into lessons for the next.
4. **Coordination & workflows** – keeping intake and spreadsheets under control.
5. **Internal / agent‑only** – meta reflection for improving our own processes.

Use this file as a map: start from the phase you are in, then open the linked template.

## 1. Volunteer communication templates

Use these when you are emailing or messaging volunteers before or after an event.

- [volunteer-welcome-email.md](volunteer-welcome-email.md)  
  One‑time welcome email for new volunteers. Sets expectations around dates, safety, privacy, and non‑carceral norms.

- [volunteer-request-template.md](volunteer-request-template.md)  
  Generic recruitment email for inviting people to sign up for a cleanup.

- [volunteer-response-devoe.md](volunteer-response-devoe.md)  
  Reply template for Devoe‑specific questions or confirmations before the event.

- [volunteer-response-mission-dolores.md](volunteer-response-mission-dolores.md)  
  Reply template for people who selected Mission Dolores. Emphasizes that SF cleanups are **future, permit‑dependent** and that nobody is automatically moved to Devoe.

- [volunteer-followup-devoe.md](volunteer-followup-devoe.md)  
  Post‑event **thank‑you and recap** email for Devoe volunteers. Pulls approximate numbers and outcomes from the Devoe `report.md` and `retrospective.md`.

- [mission-dolores-contingency-communications.md](mission-dolores-contingency-communications.md)  
  Communication templates for postponements and other contingencies related to Mission Dolores, with clear language about permits and respecting park rules.

- [post-cleanup-newsletter-snippet.md](post-cleanup-newsletter-snippet.md)  
  Short newsletter block for recapping a completed cleanup (e.g., Devoe) once `report.md` and `retrospective.md` are done and site updates are drafted.

---

## 2. Evidence & reporting templates

Use these to turn what happened on the ground into consistent, privacy‑preserving evidence.

- [cleanup-report-template.md](cleanup-report-template.md)  
  Core event report structure used to create `evidence/<park>/<date>/report.md`. Captures park, date/time, weather, approximate volunteers/volunteer‑hours, bags, areas worked (by landmark), and safety notes.

- [day-of-evidence-recap-micro-checklist.md](day-of-evidence-recap-micro-checklist.md)  
  Ultra‑short day‑of checklist to ensure you’ve captured the minimum necessary facts and photo coverage before everyone leaves.

- [devoe-park-2min-post-cleanup-recap.md](devoe-park-2min-post-cleanup-recap.md)  
  Devoe‑specific, phone‑friendly “2‑minute recap” to be filled right after the Devoe cleanup. Feeds directly into Devoe `report.md` and `retrospective.md`.

- [evidence-checklist.md](evidence-checklist.md)  
  Broader checklist for structuring evidence collection (photos, notes, file locations) across events.

- [public-post-cleanup-writeup-template.md](public-post-cleanup-writeup-template.md)  
  Template for a public recap article (site/blog/post) that stays tightly grounded in evidence and respects safety, privacy, and non‑carceral norms.

---

## 3. Retrospectives & learning templates

Use these after evidence is in place to reflect and decide what to change next time.

- [post-cleanup-retrospective.md](post-cleanup-retrospective.md)  
  General post‑cleanup retrospective template: what worked, what was hard, surprises, safety/accessibility notes, and “what we’d change.”

- [devoe-park-retrospective-template.md](devoe-park-retrospective-template.md)  
  Devoe‑specific retrospective scaffold tailored to the Feb 14 Devoe Park cleanup, with prompts about logistics, accessibility, and NYC‑specific context.

- [internal-agent-retrospective-template.md](internal-agent-retrospective-template.md)  
  Internal‑facing template for agents to analyze how our overall system performed (planning, coordination, automation, communication) after the cleanup.

---

## 4. Coordination & workflow templates

These support spreadsheet‑driven intake and coordination work.

- [first-volunteer-triage-runbook.md](first-volunteer-triage-runbook.md)  
  Runbook for the initial pass over new signups: triage, classify by park, and make sure responses go out promptly.

- [response-sheet-coordination-workflow.md](response-sheet-coordination-workflow.md)  
  Workflow for using the response sheet to coordinate assignments, avoid duplicate outreach, and track status.

- [test-form-submission-checklist.md](test-form-submission-checklist.md)  
  Checklist for safely testing and validating the signup form and its integrations without leaking PII into issues or logs.

## 5. How these templates fit the overall timeline

A rough "when to use what" guide:

- **Before the event (planning & recruitment)**  
  - Communication: `volunteer-welcome-email.md`, `volunteer-request-template.md`, `volunteer-response-devoe.md`, `volunteer-response-mission-dolores.md`, `mission-dolores-contingency-communications.md`  
  - Coordination: `first-volunteer-triage-runbook.md`, `response-sheet-coordination-workflow.md`, `test-form-submission-checklist.md`

- **Day-of and immediately after (evidence capture)**  
  - Evidence: `day-of-evidence-recap-micro-checklist.md`, `devoe-park-2min-post-cleanup-recap.md` (Devoe only), `evidence-checklist.md`

- **Within 0–72 hours post-event (reporting & recap)**  
  - Reporting: `cleanup-report-template.md` → event `report.md`  
  - Retrospectives: `post-cleanup-retrospective.md`, `devoe-park-retrospective-template.md`  
  - Public story: `public-post-cleanup-writeup-template.md`  
  - Volunteer follow‑up & newsletter: `volunteer-followup-devoe.md` (Devoe), `post-cleanup-newsletter-snippet.md`

- **After the dust settles (system learning)**  
  - Internal: `internal-agent-retrospective-template.md`

All templates assume:
- Approximate counts (volunteers, bags, volunteer‑hours) rather than exact tallies.
- No PII (names, emails, phone numbers, specific handles) in public writeups or issues.
- No faces, license plates, or identifiable encampments in public evidence.
- Clear **no‑sharps** and **non‑carceral** framing throughout.
