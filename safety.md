# Volunteer Safety & Best Practices Guide

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Wear heavy-duty work gloves at all times.
- Closed-toe shoes; boots with sturdy soles are preferred.
- Long pants and long sleeves to reduce scratches or bites.
- High-visibility clothing or vests so drivers and equipment operators can see you.

## Handling Trash & Debris
- Follow the **“Eyes Before Hands”** rule: look carefully before reaching.
- **Sharps & Needles:** Do not touch with bare or gloved hands. Use grabbers or tongs. If no sharps container is available, use a thick plastic bottle with a screw cap, label it, and hand it to site lead.  
  - SF: If an item looks unsafe to move, call 311 for pickup.  
  - NYC: Report “Syringe Litter” to 311.
- Unknown liquids: Do not touch or open containers.
- Lifting: Bend at knees and hips, keep load close, and get help for heavy or awkward items.

## Situational Awareness
- Stay alert near roads; face traffic when possible and avoid stepping into lanes.
- Keep a respectful distance from campers or people sleeping; do not disturb belongings.
- Use the Buddy System—work in pairs or within sight of teammates.

## Hygiene
- Wash or sanitize hands before eating, drinking, or leaving the site.
- Avoid touching your face; treat any cuts or scrapes promptly and keep them covered.

## Emergency Protocols
- For cuts or punctures: wash with soap and water, apply clean dressing, seek medical attention if needed.
- For contact with hazardous materials: stop work, wash exposed skin, and notify the site lead.
- For serious injury or unsafe situations: call 911 first, then inform the site lead.

## Reporting
- Log hazards (sharps, chemicals, illegal dumping, blocked paths) with location details.
- Do not put yourself at risk to remove hazards; escalate to the site lead or appropriate city service.
